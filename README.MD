# Developer Tools Challenge

Developer tools challenge is a series of gamified puzzled aimed at teaching the player about the built-in browser developer tools as well as some fundementals of web developments in a fun enticing way. It is more than inspired by the classic Python Challenge. In fact it is an attempt to make the web-developer version of it.

## Structure

Each challenge is a standalone pack of html-css-js (and likes) and is seperate from the other challenges. This is done in order to allow raw challenges with very basic fundemental approaches towards solving them. Using build tools and wrapping the challenges under one structural architetcutre would hinder this ability.

## Challenge Aspects

Each challenge has two basic aspect: **technical**, **ambigous**.

### 1. Technical

The technical aspect is solved by understanding some technical aspect (Or several in the more advanced puzzles) and manipulating the puzzle to retrieve the code for the next challange.

### 2. Ambigous

The ambgious aspect is part of the gamifying process and is meant to add interest and fun to the challenges. This means that some ambigous clues are given in each challenge about the approach or technical aspects required to solve it. However these stay in a riddle-like zone which adds an intriguing manner to the challenge. (This is extremely influenced by the classic Python Challenge)

## Game Mechanics

The game mechanics are very simple.

1. **Entry Point**: Each challenge is accessed by inputing the challenge unique code into the input form in the index.html file (This is done to avoid the neccessity for long web addresses input by the user while still avoiding a routing server, the index file input just redirects to the challenge path).

2. **Completion**: A code is found* and can be used to get to the next challenge.

* At more advanced level the code must be figured out instead of found and so the player will most likely require several attempts to get it.
